Pillow
======

Pillow is the "friendly" PIL fork. PIL is the Python Imaging Library.

Introduction
------------

The (fork) author's goal is to foster packaging improvements by publicizing
development and exploring packaging problems within the fork.

Justification
-------------

PIL is currently not setuptools compatible. Please see
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/image-sig/2010-August/006480.html for a
more detailed explanation.

Python Imaging Library
----------------------

What follows is (mostly) the original PIL documentation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds image processing capabilities
to your Python environment.  This library provides extensive file
format support, an efficient internal representation, and powerful
image processing capabilities.

This source kit has been built and tested with Python 2.0 and newer,
on Windows, Mac OS X, and major Unix platforms.  Large parts of the
library also work on 1.5.2 and 1.6.

The main distribution site for this software is:

        http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

That site also contains information about free and commercial support
options, PIL add-ons, answers to frequently asked questions, and more.

Development versions (alphas, betas) are available here:

        http://effbot.org/downloads/

The PIL handbook is not included in this distribution; to get the
latest version, check:
