Changelog
=========

v1.1.2 (2011-08-25)
-------------------

* Fixed a minor bug in how `django-appconf`_ was used.

v1.1.1 (2011-08-22)
-------------------

* Fixed resolution of relative paths in ``CachedStaticFilesStorage``.

* Started to use `django-appconf`_ and `versiontools`_.

.. _`django-appconf`: http://django-appconf.rtfd.org/
.. _`versiontools`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/versiontools

v1.1 (2011-08-18)
-----------------

* Pulled all changes from upstream Django:

  * ``static`` template tag to refer to files saved with the
    ``STATICFILES_STORAGE`` storage backend. Itâ€™ll use the storage ``url``
    method and therefore supports advanced features such as serving files
    from a cloud service.

  * ``CachedStaticFilesStorage`` which caches the files it saves (when
    running the ``collectstatic`` management command) by appending the MD5
    hash of the file's content to the filename. For example, the file
    ``css/styles.css`` would also be saved as ``css/styles.55e7cbb9ba48.css``

  * Added a ``staticfiles.storage.staticfiles_storage`` instance of the
    configured ``STATICFILES_STORAGE``.

  * ``--clear`` option for the management command which clears the
    target directory (by default ``STATIC_ROOT``) before collecting

  * Stop trying to show directory indexes in the included ``serve`` view.

  * Correctly pass kwargs to the URL patterns when using the static URL
    patterns helper.

* Use sys.stdout in management command, not self.stdout which was only
  introduced in a later Django version.

* Refactored AppSettings helper class to be only a proxy for Django's
  settings object instead of a singleton on its own.

* Updated list of supported Django versions: 1.2.X, 1.3.X and 1.4.X

* Updated list of supported Python versions: 2.5.X, 2.6.X and 2.7.X

v1.0.1 (2011-03-28)
-------------------

* Fixed an encoding related issue in the tests.

* Updated tox configuration to use 1.3 release tarball.

* Extended docs a bit.

v1.0 (2011-03-23)
-----------------

.. note:: ``django-staticfiles`` is a backport of the staticfiles app in
   Django contrib. If you're upgrading from ``django-staticfiles`` < ``1.0``,
   you'll need to make a few changes. See changes below.

* Renamed ``StaticFileStorage`` to ``StaticFilesStorage``.

* Application files should now live in a ``static`` directory in each app
  (previous versions of ``django-staticfiles`` used the name ``media``,
  which was slightly confusing).

* The management commands ``build_static`` and ``resolve_static`` are now
  called ``collectstatic`` and ``findstatic``.

* The settings ``STATICFILES_PREPEND_LABEL_APPS`` and
  ``STATICFILES_MEDIA_DIRNAMES`` were removed.

* The setting ``STATICFILES_RESOLVERS`` was removed, and replaced by the new
  ``STATICFILES_FINDERS`` setting.

* The default for ``STATICFILES_STORAGE`` was renamed from
  ``staticfiles.storage.StaticFileStorage`` to
  ``staticfiles.storage.StaticFilesStorage``

* If using ``runserver`` for local development (and the setting
  ``DEBUG`` setting is ``True``), you no longer need to add
  anything to your URLconf for serving static files in development.


v0.3.4 (2010-12-25)
-------------------

* Minor documentation update.

v0.3.3 (2010-12-23)
-------------------

.. warning:: django-staticfiles was added to Django 1.3 as a contrib app.

   The django-staticfiles 0.3.X series will only receive security and data los
   bug fixes after the release of django-staticfiles 1.0. Any Django 1.2.X
   project using django-staticfiles 0.3.X and lower should be upgraded to use
   either Django 1.3's staticfiles app or django-staticfiles >= 1.0 to profit
   from the new features and stability.

   You may want to chose to use django-staticfiles instead of Django's own
   staticfiles app since any new feature (additionally to those backported
   from Django) will be released first in django-staticfiles.

* Fixed an issue that could prevent the ``build_static`` management command
  to fail if the destination storage doesn't implement the ``listdir``
  method.

* Fixed an issue that caused non-local storage backends to fail saving
  the files when running ``build_static``.

v0.3.2 (2010-08-27)
-------------------

* Minor cosmetic changes

* Moved repository back to Github: http://github.com/jezdez/django-staticfiles

v0.3.1 (2010-08-21)
-------------------

* Added Sphinx config files and split up README.
  
  Documetation now available under
  `django-staticfiles.readthedocs.org <http://django-staticfiles.readthedocs.org/>`_

v0.3.0 (2010-08-18)
-------------------

* Added resolver API which abstract the way staticfiles finds files.

* Added staticfiles.urls.staticfiles_urlpatterns to avoid the catch-all
  URLpattern which can make top-level urls.py slightly more confusing.
  From Brian Rosner.

* Minor documentation changes

* Updated testrunner to work with Django 1.1.X and 1.2.X.

* Removed custom code to load storage backend.

v0.2.0 (2009-11-25)
-------------------

* Renamed build_media and resolve_media management commands to build_static
  and resolve_media to avoid confusions between Django's use of the term
  "media" (for uploads) and "static" files.

* Rework most of the internal logic, abstracting the core functionality away
  from the management commands.

* Use file system storage backend by default, ability to override it with
  custom storage backend

* Removed --interactive option to streamline static file resolving.

* Added extensive tests

* Uses standard logging

v0.1.2 (2009-09-02)
-------------------

* Fixed a typo in settings.py

* Fixed a conflict in build_media (now build_static) between handling
  non-namespaced app media and other files with the same relative path.

v0.1.1 (2009-09-02)
-------------------

* Added README with a bit of documentation :)

v0.1.0 (2009-09-02)
-------------------

* Initial checkin from Pinax' source.

* Will create the STATIC_ROOT directory if not existent.
